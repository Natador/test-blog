Hi! I'm Nathaniel. I'm currently working at Allison Transmission in the Data Analytics and R&D group. I'm a Computer Engineering and Math major, and I'm far-more addicted to the latter.

I'm still figuring out what I want to put on this blog, but you can check out some of my previous projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/natador).

## About this Blog

This blog is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is hosted as a [Digital Ocean App](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform). The theme is [Hugo-Kiera](https://github.com/funkydan2/hugo-kiera), which I think looks pretty nice.
