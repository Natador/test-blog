Many in my personal circle have asked for it, so here's my guacamole recipe.

Ingredients
- 3 medium Hass avocados (not too soft, not too hard)
- 1/2 red onion, diced finely (can also use white/yellow onion)
- 2-3 jalapenos, seeds removed and diced (leave membrane if you want more heat)
- Juice of 2-3 limes (start with 1.5)
- 1 medium bunch Cilantro
- Salt (around 1tsp to start)
- (Optional) 1 roma (or other) tomato, seeds/juice removed and diced

Finely dice onion and jalapeno and put into a bowl. Cut avocados in half, remove seed, and scoop the inside into the bowl. I like to remove any brown/bruised bits of avocado.

Then, using the bottom of a drinking glass, mash avocados into onion/jalapeno. This will imbue the onion/jalapeno flavor into the mixed avocado.

Add finely chopped cilantro (I usually just wack off the bottom half of the stems, and any that are really thick, but the stems still taste good!). Then add juice of 1.5 limes, and about 1 tsp of salt. If you have tomato, add it now.

Mix well and taste. If it's lacking flavor, add lime. If it's too limey, add salt. If it's too salty, add lime. You're looking to balance these according to your taste. It can take a few times adding these back-and-forth to get the right balance. The texture should be firm, but still wet. If it looks dry, you probably need to add more lime, but if it's already too limey, you can use a little bit of water to thin it out (start with 1 Tbsp).

Store in the fridge in an airtight container with plastic wrap pushed up against the surface of the guacamole. This will keep it from getting too brown.
